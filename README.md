## Example of xlsform manipulation in Python

The goal here is to show that it is possible to insert a value 
into an xlsform that can then be used in notes, conditions or computations later 
on in the form. 

So, for a given campaign, it would be easy to generate the form 
that will check if the round that was picked is actually matching
the current date, of to preselect the type of vaccine manipulated.
